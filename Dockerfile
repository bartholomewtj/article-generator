# Backend image for the hosted deployment.

# Serves the JSON API that index.html calls. It holds no API keys and writes
# nothing to disk: ARTICLEGEN_STATELESS makes every draft render-and-return, so
# a restart loses nothing and no visitor can read another visitor's article.
#
# Host-neutral. Every host that matters injects PORT and expects the app to bind
# it, which the CMD below does. Currently deployed on Render (see render.yaml);
# it also runs unchanged on Fly, Cloud Run, or a plain `docker run`.
