    "abstract": (
        "Sleep occupies roughly a third of human life, and its function has been "
        "debated for as long as it has been measured. Two decades of work in rodents "
        "and humans have converged on the view that sleep is not a passive interruption "
        "of waking but a state in which specific physiological processes run that cannot "
        "run efficiently during wakefulness. Here the evidence for two such processes is "
        "reviewed: the consolidation of newly encoded memories through coordinated "
        "hippocampal-cortical replay, and the clearance of interstitial metabolites, "
        "including amyloid-beta, through the glymphatic system. Behavioural and imaging "
        "studies in humans support a consolidation role, and targeted reactivation "
        "experiments indicate that the process can be biased experimentally. Clearance "
        "evidence remains dominated by rodent work, and recent findings suggest that "
        "circadian phase contributes independently of sleep state. Vulnerability to sleep "
        "loss varies substantially and heritably between individuals, which limits the "
        "generality of population-level estimates. Taken together, the two functions "
        "provide a mechanistic account of why sleep loss degrades cognition, and identify "
        "the human clearance literature as the principal gap."

                "with a causal role: participants who sleep after learning show better "
                "retention than those kept awake for an equivalent interval [2].",
