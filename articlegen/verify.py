"""Deterministic grounding check for the statistics in a generated article.

The writer sees titles, abstracts, plus — for open-access sources — the same
full-text excerpts that `sources.full_text_excerpts` yields. It is prone to
stating precise figures (effect sizes, confidence intervals, risk ratios) it was
never shown. This pass extracts the figures the article asserts and checks
whether each appears in that same material. Anything missing is surfaced to the
reader as "verify against the full text" rather than trusted.

The haystack is exactly what the writer was shown (title, abstract, and shown
full-text excerpt), not the whole retrieved paper: searching text the writer
never saw would let a figure recalled from training pass as grounded.
`full_text_excerpts` is deterministic over the papers, so both sides derive the
same excerpts without anything recorded.

**A cited sentence is checked against its own sources only.** Searching every
source and passing on any hit is what this used to do, and it hid the failure
that most changes clinical meaning: a real number lifted from paper 12 and
credited in the prose to paper 3 passed silently as verified. That case is now
reported separately as `misattributed` — the figure is real, the attribution is
not. A sentence citing nothing has no attribution to break, so it is still
checked against everything.

It is intentionally deterministic — an LLM verifier can hallucinate agreement;
substring presence in the real source text cannot. The corollary is that the
check is deliberately generous about *form*: it asks whether the number is
there at all, not whether the surrounding words match. A missed figure is a
warning the reader never sees; a false flag is a wrong warning printed in the
article.

# checking every loose number produces noise, not grounding. Longer forms come

# A hyphenated range is ONE quantity. Scanning "4.4-5.2" with the plain decimal
# alternative alone matched "4.4" and then "-5.2" -- a negative number the
# article never asserted and no source contains, so a real confidence interval
# printed a flag on its own second half (#189). This alternative is first in the
# alternation so it wins at the position where the range starts; `_found` then
# requires BOTH endpoints, which keeps the check strict about presence while
# staying generous about form (a source writing "4.4 to 5.2" still verifies).
