"""Deterministic prose-style check against journal writing conventions.

`verify.py` checks that the *numbers* in a draft are grounded. This checks that
the *prose* reads like a journal article rather than a magazine feature — the
conventions are specific enough to test, so we test them instead of hoping the
model followed the prompt:

- no second person, contractions, rhetorical questions or exclamations
- no booster/hype vocabulary ("clearly", "dramatically", "groundbreaking")
- no absolute claims of proof from observational evidence
- first person only in the reviewing frame journals actually use ("here we review")
- hedging present at roughly the density corpus studies report for research
  articles — about one hedge every two to three sentences
- sentences of a readable length

Everything here is a regex over the draft's own text. Like `verify.py`, it is
deliberately not an LLM pass: a model asked "is this journal style?" will agree
with itself. `docs/journal-style.md` records where each convention comes from.

`cli.cmd_draft` runs this after `write_article` and, when it finds errors, sends
them back to the model once for a targeted revision.
