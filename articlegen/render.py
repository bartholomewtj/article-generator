    *Security.* The web app shows the article in an iframe, and until this
    existed that iframe ran same-origin with the visitor's API key in
    localStorage. It is fed model-written HTML, and worse, `#read=` and `#p=`
    links let anyone hand a visitor a page of their choosing. A `sandbox`
    attribute fixes that, but a sandbox without `allow-scripts` would leave the
    toolbar's buttons present and dead. Removing them is what makes the sandbox
    free (issue #100).

    *Duplication.* The app already has a sticky action bar with Share, Copy link
    and a theme toggle, so in that context the in-article toolbar was a second
    copy of controls the page around it already provides.

    A file written to `drafts/` is opened directly in a browser with no app
